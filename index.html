    <h1> The magnitude and distribution Japanese earthquake (2000-2022) </h1>
    <description>The data, collected from the USGS website, records historical
      earthquake data of <b>magnitude 6 or greater</b> that have occurred <b>in
        Japan since 2000</b>. The data set contains information on the time,
      location, intensity and magnitude of each major earthquake, as well as
      the focal depth.</description><br><br><br>

      <h2> Background About Japan</h2>
      <p>Japan's is located at the intersection of multiple tectonic plates,
        coupled with related trenches and active volcanic activity, makes it an
        earthquake-prone region.</p>

            <b>Magnitude:</b>
            a scale that quantifies the energy release of an
            earthquake. It is a logarithmic scale, where an increase of 1.0
            indicates roughly 32 times more energy release. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Focal Depth: </b>
            describes the depth underground where the earthquake rupture
            begins. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Scale: </b> <br>

      <h2> Distribution on Map </h2>
      <div id="earthquake_map"></div> <br>
      <p>
        Earthquakes in Japan occur mainly in the ocean, which is the main reason
        for the frequent tsunamis in Japan. The most frequent quakes occurred off
        the eastern coast of Japan, followed by the Kyushu and Ryukyu Islands in
        the southwest and the Hokkaido region in the north. <br>
        <br>
        The most famous of these is the massive Tohoku earthquake and subsequent
        tsunami in 2011, which directly led to the nuclear leakage incident and has
        long troubled the Japanese government and people.

      <p>
        - The average magnitude of Japan's larger quakes is generally below
        magnitude 7.
        <br>
        - The average focal depth has been below 50km for quite long time,
        which means they tend to be more destructive.
        <br>
        - In most years, earthquakes of magnitude 6 or above that occur in
        Japan have a frequency of less than 5.

            it is obvious that earthquakes with

              There seems to be <b>no absolute numerical relationship</b> between magnitude and focal depth.
              <br><br>
              But it is clear that most of the earthquakes <b>with major or great scale</b> are of shallow origin,
              which means their focal depth <b>are under 70km</b>.
              <br><br>
              This also shows that earthquakes <b>with shallower focal depth</b> tends to be <b>more destructive</b>.
              <br><br>
              Earthquakes with deeper focal depths are relatively less destructive because their energy has weakened as
              it travels to the surface.
